## FAQ

#### Is it really secure?

Yes, we use a peer-to-peer system. That way, as soon as the person who created the chat room leaves, the conversation is immediately deleted.

#### Will there be a web version?
W.I.P

#### Why does Windows say the executable is a virus?
False detection. But if you're really afraid of using it on your real hardware, then use a VM!

#### Can the chat service go down?
It all depends, as it's still in development. For the PC version, maybe, but for the web version, it will probably run 24/7.

#### If one of the versions encounters problems, what should I do?
You should contact the creator by sending an email to:
